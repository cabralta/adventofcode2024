# Learning golang with Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com/2024/

## Learnings
### Day 1 

* Golang doesn't have absolute function for other types included in the standard libs. float64 is the only supported type, which requires creation of a function to turn negative values positive. 
* Assignment with `:=` and `=` is becoming clearer but need to solidify use cases for better memory of which to use.
* Able to load a file and parse it, but this seems more  cumbersome & brittle than it should be. Need to see more patterns of implementation.
* Started testing, struggled with loading packages and package management when there are several subdirectories
* Helper / Utility lib will help going forward
* Testing was very helpful to validate code
* Additional optimization and testing can improve performance
* Need to see more patterns and understand for looping with ranges better.
